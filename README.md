## üéØ Project Overview

### **Objective**

The primary objective of this bachelor thesis is to design, implement, and evaluate a spam email detection system. This involves:

1.  **Building a robust text classification model:** Utilizing a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network in TensorFlow/Keras to effectively learn patterns in text data for accurate spam detection.
2.  **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Thoroughly evaluating the model's performance using various metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve, AUC, and Confusion Matrix.
3.  **Web Application Deployment:** Creating a user-friendly web application using Flask to deploy the trained model, enabling users to interact with the spam detection system through a web interface.

### **Key Tasks**

1.  **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
    *   Loading and cleaning the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
    *   Implementing text preprocessing steps including:
        *   Lowercasing.
        *   Tokenization.
        *   Removal of digits and special characters.
        *   Stop word removal (English).
        *   Lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer.
        *   Stemming using Porter Stemmer.
    *   Tokenizing text data and padding sequences for consistent input to the neural network.

2.  **BiLSTM Model Development and Training:**
    *   Designing a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
    *   Training the BiLSTM model on the preprocessed SMS Spam Collection dataset.
    *   Saving the trained model and tokenizer for deployment.
    *   Monitoring training progress and optimizing model parameters.

3.  **Model Evaluation and Visualization:**
    *   Evaluating the trained BiLSTM model on a test dataset.
    *   Generating comprehensive evaluation metrics:
        *   Accuracy.
        *   Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
        *   Confusion Matrix (visualized as a heatmap).
        *   Learning Curve (Training Loss vs. Validation Loss).
        *   ROC Curve and AUC Score.
        *   Precision-Recall Curve and Average Precision Score.
    *   Saving evaluation metrics and visualizations for analysis and reporting.

4.  **Flask Web Application Development and Deployment:**
    *   Developing a Flask web application to serve as the user interface for the spam detection system.
    *   Creating web routes for:
        *   Homepage.
        *   Text Spam Detection: Allows users to input text and get real-time spam probability and classification.
        *   Email Spam Detection: Allows users to connect to their Gmail inbox (user-authenticated) and classify the first 30 emails in their inbox as spam or not spam.
    *   Integrating the trained BiLSTM model into the Flask application for real-time predictions.
